# Radiant Ledger App — Planning & Verification

Docs, brainstorm, plan, Python oracle, golden-vector fixtures, and investigation notes for the community [**Radiant Ledger Nano S Plus app**](https://github.com/MudwoodLabs/app-radiant).

The code lives in separate repos (see below). This repo is the paper trail — how it was designed, how its correctness was verified before touching mainnet, and the full arc of what went right and what went wrong.

## Status

**v1 walking skeleton landed 2026-04-15.** First mainnet-confirmed Radiant tx signed by a Ledger Nano S Plus: [`de3574979f…56893743`](https://explorer.radiantblockchain.org/tx/de3574979f986616b4152c4294b85562318292490d3587d8fe32aff456893743). Beta; looking for testers.

**Glyph NFT/FT classification + view-only renderer landed 2026-04-16.** Browser-based tool that classifies and renders Glyph assets (NFTs + FTs) for Ledger-owned addresses via Radiant Core RPC. First Ledger-signed Glyph NFT spend: [`22d4e0e072…24b71da3`](https://explorer.radiantblockchain.org/tx/22d4e0e07200437791b48651125a636b994593b215152241aef7113b24b71da3). Details in the [Glyph section below](#glyph-nftft-support--view-only-renderer).

## Quick verification (no hardware needed)

Confirm the Python oracle still produces correct Radiant sighashes:

```bash
cd scripts
python3 oracle_self_validate.py
# Exit 0 = 3-way validation PASS. Oracle is trusted as ground truth.

python3 test_oracle_against_vectors.py
# Exit 0 = oracle output matches all 16 sighashes in the fixture set.
```

Anyone running these on a clean clone gets the same result — pure Python + stdlib + `ecdsa`.

## Glyph NFT/FT support — view-only renderer

The Ledger app already signs Glyph-wrapped UTXOs correctly (proved with the [`22d4e0e072…24b71da3` mainnet spend](https://explorer.radiantblockchain.org/tx/22d4e0e07200437791b48651125a636b994593b215152241aef7113b24b71da3)), but Electron-Wallet's script classifier doesn't recognize them. `view-only-ui/` closes the gap with a browser-based tool that classifies, enumerates, and renders Glyph assets for any Radiant address.

**Three on-chain shapes** (verified against 2309 mainnet FT samples, 6 tokens, 500 blocks). A *ref* is a 36-byte outpoint (txid + vout) that uniquely identifies a Glyph token. A *photon* is Radiant's base unit (analogous to a satoshi). Electron-Wallet is Radiant's desktop wallet, forked from Electron Cash.

| Shape | Size | Pattern | Wallet action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plain P2PKH | 25B | `76a914 <pkh:20> 88ac` | Show RXD balance |
| NFT singleton | 63B | `d8 <ref:36> 75 76a914 <pkh:20> 88ac` | Show NFT with ref |
| FT holder | 75B | `76a914 <pkh:20> 88ac bd d0 <ref:36> dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d` | Group + sum by ref |

The FT suffix is Radiant's consensus-level fungibility clause: `OP_STATESEPARATOR` (0xbd, runtime NOP) separates a standard P2PKH prologue from an epilogue that enforces token-conservation via `OP_CODESCRIPTHASHVALUESUM_UTXOS/_OUTPUTS`. The spend signature is `<sig> <pubkey>` — unchanged from plain P2PKH.

Run the demo:

```bash
cd view-only-ui
node server.js                                   # proxy → VPS radiant-cli (:3999)
python3 -m http.server 8788 --bind 127.0.0.1     # serve UI
# open http://127.0.0.1:8788/
```

Verify the classifier:

```bash
node view-only-ui/fixtures/test_classifier.mjs --verbose
# 15 passed, 0 failed
```

## Verifying a device build on your own hardware

See the main app's [`BUILDER.md`](https://github.com/MudwoodLabs/app-radiant/blob/main/BUILDER.md) for reproducibility, or the `scripts/task-0.0-runbook.md` for the Phase 0.0 sideload-test procedure.

## How v1 got built

1. **Brainstorm** (`/workflows:brainstorm`) — "community Ledger Nano S Plus app for RXD." Decided fork vs rewrite, SLIP-44 512 vs 0, which devices to target. ([doc](docs/brainstorms/2026-04-14-radiant-ledger-app-v1-brainstorm.md))
2. **Plan** (`/workflows:plan`) — 6 phases: bootstrap → C app → plugin → first sign → hardening → community validation → release. ([doc](docs/plans/2026-04-14-feat-radiant-ledger-app-v1-plan.md))
3. **Phase 0 bootstrap** — repo scaffolding, CI pinned by digest, LSB-014 path-lock verification on-device.
4. **Phase 1 walking skeleton** — C diff + plugin change + sideload + first address derivation. Got as far as "device signs tx, mainnet rejects it with script-execution-error."
5. **Diagnosis** — traced the rejection to `hashOutputHashes`, a new 32-byte field Radiant inserts in the preimage that BCH's signing path doesn't produce. Walking-skeleton strategy paid off — caught the issue at 1 RXD of risk rather than post-release.
6. **Remediation brainstorm + plan** (`2026-04-15-*`) — Strategy A (device independently computes `hashOutputHashes`), canonical P2PKH enforcement as v1 simplification, Python oracle first for byte-level verification.
7. **Phase 1.5.0 pre-check** — verified 5 spec details against canonical sources before writing code.
8. **Phase 1.5.1 oracle** — ported [`radiantjs sighash.js:91-237`](https://github.com/RadiantBlockchain/radiantjs/blob/master/lib/transaction/sighash.js#L91) to Python. Triple-validated: mainnet tx sig + hand-computed byte-diff + second-signer mainnet tx. 16 sighashes verified against real mainnet signatures.
9. **Phase 1.5.2 golden vectors** — 4 real mainnet RXD txs curated as test fixtures; every sighash verified at build time.
10. **Phase 1.5.3 C implementation** — ~300 lines across lib-app-bitcoin. Per-output streaming FSM, hashOutputHashes accumulator, preimage insertion, reset-path coverage, plugin pre-check, runtime assertion.
11. **Phase 1.5.4 device-vs-oracle** — device-signed tx signature verifies locally against oracle sighash + device pubkey via secp256k1. Caught and fixed a byte-feeder placement bug (inside OUTPUT case, not post-switch).
12. **Phase 1.5.5 mainnet broadcast** — [`de3574979f…56893743`](https://explorer.radiantblockchain.org/tx/de3574979f986616b4152c4294b85562318292490d3587d8fe32aff456893743) confirmed in block 420762.

## v2 scope (tracked, not started)

- Electron-Wallet classifier patch — recognize NFT (63B) and FT (75B) wrappers so Glyph UTXOs appear in the Coins tab and can be spent from the GUI. [Regex patterns are ready](view-only-ui/classifier.mjs); needs integration into Electron-Wallet's `ScriptType` / `get_address_from_output_script` path.
- Real `GetPushRefs` opcode scan → enables P2SH destinations, OP_RETURN memos, and non-P2PKH wrapping variants
- `SIGHASH_SINGLE` + `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` support
- Schnorr signature emission (shorter sigs → lower fees)
- Speculos / Ragger emulator CI
- Nano X, Stax, Flex device support
- Official Ledger listing (post community validation)

See [v1 plan Future Considerations](docs/plans/2026-04-14-feat-radiant-ledger-app-v1-plan.md) and [remediation v2 Tracking](docs/brainstorms/2026-04-15-hashoutputhashes-remediation-brainstorm.md) for details.

## Looking for testers

Have a Nano S Plus and some spare RXD? Open an issue here (or in the [`app-radiant` repo](https://github.com/MudwoodLabs/app-radiant)) to help validate across firmware versions and tx shapes before v1.0 release.
